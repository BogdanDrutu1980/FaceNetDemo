High prio task:
Topic 2 - deadline: 2 Feb 2020

First problem: incompatibility between python packages after updating to tensorflow 15.0.2 -> requirements.txt
The environment exported from Visual Studio -> requirements.txt its not working anymore. 
How to fix it???
It is a nightmare :-)
Possible solution: setup django and all packages one by one and after -> export a new environment
