FaceNetDemo application

This application is for demonstration and learning purpose only.
It was created to learn:
- basic concepts of deep learning using a popular algo for Face Detection
- basic concepts of django web development
- basic concepts of cloud computing (hosting in Azure)

TBD

It can be combined (merged) with what is intended to develop in RoadTraffic:
Scenario 1:
The system developed in RoadTraffic will send images to FaceNetDemo for person recognition.
Scenario 2:
Draft idea: a drone system - using the same board -nVidia
